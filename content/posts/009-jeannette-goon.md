* Who are you and what do you do?

    >  I’m a writer. Everything else I do—running my ecommerce company, working on new business ideas, organizing events—is part of a bigger goal to keep collecting stories and/or satisfy my curiosity.

* What makes you get up in the morning?

    > My alarm going off! I’m so not a morning person but knowing that time is the one resource that’s totally limited and that there’s so much that I want to do, gets me out of bed.

* What keeps you up at night?

    > I’d like to say that there are deep questions or world-impacting problems keeping me up at night. But the truth is, stories—whether in books or on screen—keep me up at night. I’m a sucker for crime fiction with semi-supernatural elements and have on occasion stayed up till 5am reading. As much as I love my work, I like to let my mind play and wander at night.

* The one thing you regret the most.

    > Spending too much of my youth reading and thinking, rather than just going out and doing shit.

* What is the one thing you've learned and want to pass on to the next generation?

    > Most of the time I think that those younger than me are at an advantage because they’ve grown up in a tech-infused world, so perhaps I don’t really have “wise words” to pass on to them. But one thing I’ve learned is that it’s okay to make mistakes, because that means I’m learning.
