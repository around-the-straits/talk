* Who are you and what do you do?

    >  My name is Justin, and I'm a management consultant as well as a dabbler in way too many hobbies and activities.

* What makes you get up in the morning?

    > Sunlight.

    > In truth I'm not sure how to answer this question. I have short and long term goals in life, but I would not consider those the reason I exist. There may be little pleasures in life I look forward to each day, but again I would not call it the reason I get up each morning. People tend to either manufacture / choose their own purpose, or leave it in the hands of a higher power. Or just exist, day to day. At this point, I guess I'm doing my best to experience and enjoy life, trying out new things and activities which catches my interest.

* What keeps you up at night?

    > I generally sleep well at night. Deeply and quickly too. My wife is quite jealous about this actually.

* The one thing you regret the most.

    > My terrible attitude towards alot of people in my life due to misguided notions and thinking. Something I'm trying to actively work on.

* What is the one thing you've learned and want to pass on to the next generation?

    > Just try, it will be better than looking back and always wondering 'what if'.

* What is the one thing that we should have asked, but we didn't, and what's the answer?

    > **What is one thing I'm grateful for in my life?** My wife, my family, my friends, people who have helped me and stuck by me even when I don't deserve it; or especially when I don't deserve it.
