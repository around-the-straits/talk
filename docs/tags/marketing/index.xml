&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are you and what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm, the first question seems to be the hardest one of all! I am a dreamer, a romantic and an idealist who believes that people are inherently good. Words, music, autumn leaves and antiquity (old buildings, artifacts, places of history) are what gives me the fuzzies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to what I do&amp;hellip; by profession, Iâ€™m a marketing professional. In other words, I try to make people buy stuff by helping them see why they need it. I also freelance as a copywriter, and I sing in a choir too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
