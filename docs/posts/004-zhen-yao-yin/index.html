Who are you and what do you do?


My name is Zhen, and I work in a bank to earn money to pay for my hobbies, which mostly involve making travel vlogs and other videos which I put up on youtube.com/zhenyaoyin (shameless plug).

<li><p>Who are you and what do you do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Zhen, and I work in a bank to earn money to pay for my hobbies, which mostly involve making travel vlogs and other videos which I put up on <a href="youtube.com/zhenyaoyin">youtube.com/zhenyaoyin</a> (shameless plug).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What makes you get up in the morning?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creating things that make people stop and think to themselves, “This is pretty cool!” I always try to sneak in my own sense of style and humour into my work, much to my colleagues’ chagrin.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What keeps you up at night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How to some day turn my ‘second job’ into my ‘real job’. Until then, I don’t mind climbing the corporate ladder as that helps pay for my trips to far-off places.</p>

<p>I would also like to do something to help solve the problem of food wastage. Isn’t it a bit silly that so much perfectly good food gets thrown away while there are people still starving?</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>The one thing you regret the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not going on a work-and-travel/working holiday programme to the US or any other country after graduating. Now I’ll never know what it’s like to work at a theme park!.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing you&rsquo;ve learned and want to pass on to the next generation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of comparing yourself to others, instead ask yourself: “Would ‘me’ from 5/10/15 years ago be proud of the person I am today?” It is always a good idea to take a step back and reflect on the things that you have achieved. And if the answer is a ‘no’, what can you do to turn that into a ‘yes’?</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing that we should have asked, but we didn&rsquo;t, and what&rsquo;s the answer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If money weren’t an issue and you could do anything you want for a living, what would that be?</strong> It’s a toss up between being a host for a travel show or doing musical theatre. However, my rational mind thought better of it so I pursued a stable, corporate job instead.</p>
