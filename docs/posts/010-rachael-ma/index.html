<li><p>Who are you and what do you do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>II&rsquo;m Rachael and I was previously a management consultant for 6 years, however I left that line of work to be involved in Christian missions work in Mozambique, Africa.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What makes you get up in the morning?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty exciting opportunity to be able to wake up each morning and know that you&rsquo;re not living just for yourself, but you&rsquo;re able to pour and invest into other people&rsquo;s lives and see change. Sometimes it may not be big or noticeable act but it does make a difference to them.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What keeps you up at night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pressures of work and stress from bosses used to sometimes keep me up at night, but since leaving the corporate world I don&rsquo;t think there are many things that can disrupt my sleep besides the occasional relationship issues, fight with a friend or perhaps a family member.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>The one thing you regret the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like to dwell on regrets much because the past is gone, but if I had to pick then perhaps it would&rsquo;ve been to just take more time to travel around during my summers in college. In the ambition to pad my resume before applying for jobs I got an internship for <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of my summers, which could probably have been better spent traveling and exploring around the US :)</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing you&rsquo;ve learned and want to pass on to the next generation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being in Africa I&rsquo;m slowly learning what it means to love others in need and to value every member of society, regardless of socioeconomic standing. Being amongst the poor in different nations I&rsquo;ve seen that there&rsquo;s a lot we can learn from them and I&rsquo;d want my kids and those in the next generation to be ones who will learn to love and value everyone around them.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing that we should have asked, but we didn’t, and what’s the answer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;With your life lived, what would you want to be known for / your tombstone to read?&rdquo;</strong> I would want mine to include the fact that I was a loving mother and someone that did make a positive impact to the people that I interacted with over my seasons of life.</p>
</blockquote></li>
