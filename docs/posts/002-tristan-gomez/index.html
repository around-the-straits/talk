Who are you and what do you do?


I&rsquo;m Tristan Gomez, also known as @parasquid in Github, Facebook, and mostly everywhere else on the Internet. When I&rsquo;m not tap dancing my fingers on keyboards, I strut my stuff on the dance floor. Sometimes, I don my magical slippers and dabble in the fine art of Ruby programming. There&rsquo;s also some rumors floating around that I&rsquo;m a Jedi Master in disguise.

<li><p>Who are you and what do you do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m Tristan Gomez, also known as <code>@parasquid</code> in Github, Facebook, and mostly everywhere else on the Internet. When I&rsquo;m not tap dancing my fingers on keyboards, I strut my stuff on the dance floor. Sometimes, I don my magical slippers and dabble in the fine art of Ruby programming.

<ul>
<li><p>What makes you get up in the morning?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oftentimes there would be this really difficult problem that I spend most of my day trying to solve, and then I&rsquo;d decide to sleep on it. And most of the time, the answer would come to me just as soon as the alarm clock starts ringing. I&rsquo;d be so excited to try out this new approach that my subsconscious had somehow solved while I was asleep.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also the stuff that I want to learn, or I want to practice and get good at. The field of software is both a blessing and a curse; there&rsquo;s no end to the intellectual stimulation you can get by trying to build systems and processes in your mind, but technology is always changing at a rapid pace that if you even stop learning just a little bit, you&rsquo;d be left so far behind it&rsquo;s really difficult to catch up.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What keeps you up at night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would often wonder what would happen if everyone can read everyone else&rsquo;s mind, in a sort of &ldquo;mind meld.&rdquo; On one hand, it would solve nearly all kinds of misunderstandings and might even herald a whole new era of peace and empathy. On the other hand, I wonder what would happen to individuality and self-determination?</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>The one thing you regret the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could have started my software development career 10 years earlier. I feel I could have accomplished so much more if I had the courage then to pursue what I was passionate about, rather than doing what I felt was the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; career.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing you&rsquo;ve learned and want to pass on to the next generation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every moment is important and should be cherished, because&ndash;be it a sad moment, or a happy moment&ndash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass">this too, shall pass</a>.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>What is the one thing that we should have asked, but we didn&rsquo;t, and what&rsquo;s the answer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Where can we find out more about you?</strong> I write (sometimes) at my <a href="http://life.beyondrails.com/">software blog</a> and my <a href="http://www.hackworkplay.com/">hardware blog</a></p>
